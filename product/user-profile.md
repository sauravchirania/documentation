# User Profile

## Your profile

You can use your Open Collective user profile to let people know a bit about you. Projects you back might want to reach out to you, or you may want to use this page to show off your contributions or the Collectives you manage.

You can access your profile settings by using the dropdown menu on your username and going to the **Profile** page.

On your **Profile** page, you are able to customize the following:

### Cover image

The optimal size for a cover image is 2736x650.&#x20;

After uploading an image, you are able to adjust it as you wish by either moving it and zooming in and out.

## Advanced settings

### Deleting your account

{% hint style="warning" %}
You are only able to delete your account if it has no activity registered such as donations and expenses. Therefore, accounts with a history of transactions cannot be deleted —they are part of Collective budgets and their integrity and accuracy depend on those records. You may archive your account instead.
{% endhint %}

To delete your account, go to the **Delete this Account** section and click on **Delete this account**.

### Archiving your account

If your account has a history of transactions, your only option is archiving your account. Archived accounts will appear as inactive accounts and no new activity will be allowed. The next time subscriptions are due to be renewed (1st of the month), they will be cancelled.

To archive your account, go to the **Archive this Account** section and click on **Archive this account**.

## Using Open Collective Anonymously

You can sign up using a pseudonym. We understand that not everyone can or wants to show their real name on public Collective budgets.

If you are getting paid through the platform, we will need some personally identifiable information. However, these documents (invoices and tax forms, for example) are not public and only admins will be able to see them.
