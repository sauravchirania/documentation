# Connected Collectives

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating connected collectives is [a manual process](broken-reference) at the moment. If you want to do it, please contact us at [support@opencollective.com](mailto:support@opencollective.com) describing what you'd like.
{% endhint %}

Connected collectives are a way to display the different collectives or local projects that came out of your main initiative. Collectives are not strongly tied together:

* They **don't** share the same budget
* They can have different hosts, with different currencies
* Admins of one Collective are **not** automatically admin of the other

On the Collective page, connected collectives will be displayed under `More ways to contribute`

Connected collectives feature works for Organizations and Users profiles too:
